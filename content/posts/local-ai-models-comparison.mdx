    let mut right = arr.len();
    
    while left < right {
        let mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
        match arr[mid].cmp(target) {
            std::cmp::Ordering::Equal => return Some(mid),
            std::cmp::Ordering::Less => left = mid + 1,

## Model Selection Guide

### Choose Phi-2 if:
- Running on edge devices
- Need fastest possible responses
- Limited RAM (< 8GB)
- Simple tasks only

### Choose Llama 2 7B if:
- General purpose assistant
- Balanced performance needs
- Well-documented use case
- Community support important

### Choose Mistral 7B if:
- Need best quality in 7B class
- Fast responses important
- Reasoning tasks
- Limited resources (8-16GB RAM)

### Choose Code Llama if:
- Primarily coding tasks
- Code generation/review
- Developer tools
- Can spare 8GB RAM

### Choose Mixtral 8x7B if:
- Highest quality needed
- Production applications
- Complex reasoning required
- Have 32GB+ RAM

## Memory Requirements

**Minimum specs by model:**

```
Phi-2:         4GB RAM
7B models:     8GB RAM  (16GB recommended)
13B models:    16GB RAM (32GB recommended)
Mixtral:       32GB RAM (64GB recommended)
```

**GPU considerations:**

- Not required but speeds up inference 3-5x
- 8GB VRAM: All 7B models
- 16GB VRAM: 13B models comfortable
- 24GB+ VRAM: Mixtral with quantization

## Quantization Trade-offs

Models can be quantized to reduce size:

| Format | Size | Quality Loss |
|--------|------|--------------|
| FP16   | 100% | 0% (baseline) |
| Q8     | 50%  | ~1% |
| Q4     | 25%  | ~3-5% |
| Q2     | 12.5% | ~10-15% |

**Recommendation:** Use Q4 for good balance

```bash
# Specify quantization
ollama pull mistral:7b-q4
```

## Conclusion

**My recommendations:**

1. **Starting out?** → Mistral 7B
2. **Coding focus?** → Code Llama 13B
3. **Resource constrained?** → Phi-2
4. **Production/quality?** → Mixtral 8x7B
5. **General purpose?** → Llama 2 7B

Remember: The best model depends on your specific use case. Start with Mistral 7B and experiment from there.

## Next Steps

1. Install Ollama
2. Try 2-3 models on your actual use case
3. Measure performance and quality
4. Choose based on your constraints
5. Monitor and iterate
