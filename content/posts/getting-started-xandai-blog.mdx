## Welcome

Welcome to XandAI, a technical blog focused on artificial intelligence, self-hosted models, and practical engineering experiments.

## What You'll Find Here

This blog covers:

- **AI & Machine Learning**: Practical applications and experiments
- **Self-Hosted Models**: Running LLMs locally with Ollama, LM Studio
- **Engineering Notes**: Real-world solutions and learnings
- **Open Source**: Tools and projects from the XandAI ecosystem

## Why Self-Hosted?

Self-hosting AI models gives you:

1. **Privacy**: Your data never leaves your machine
2. **Cost**: No API fees after initial setup
3. **Control**: Customize and fine-tune as needed
4. **Offline**: Works without internet
5. **Learning**: Understand how models actually work

## The XandAI Ecosystem

XandAI is a collection of open-source tools:

### [XandAI CLI](https://github.com/XandAI-project/Xandai-CLI)

A terminal-based AI coding assistant that works entirely offline.

```bash
pip install xandai-cli
xandai ask "How do I use async/await in Python?"
```

### [XandAI Extension](https://github.com/XandAI-project/XandAI-Extension)

Chrome extension to interact with LLMs directly from your browser.

### [XandPersona](https://github.com/XandAI-project/XandPersona)

Create and manage social media personas with AI using offline models.

### [XandAI WebUI](https://github.com/XandAI-project/XandAI)

Ollama WebUI interface for easy model management.

## What Makes This Blog Different

- **Opinionated but Calm**: Clear positions backed by experience
- **Code-First**: Real examples, not just theory
- **Self-Hosted Focus**: Privacy and control matter
- **No Fluff**: Technical depth without unnecessary complexity

## Topics Coming Soon

Upcoming posts will cover:

- Building production-ready AI applications
- Comparing open-source models (Llama, Mistral, etc)
- Optimizing inference performance
- Fine-tuning for specific tasks
- RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) implementations
- Self-hosting best practices

## Get Involved

All XandAI projects are open source:
